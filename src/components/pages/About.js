      <p>
          I am new to web development.  These days I spend my time learning about HTML, CSS, 
          Javascript and Nodes. I am excited to continue to gain more skills as a developer 
          so that I can implement these into my new role in the workplace. 
          During my free time I like to spend time with my family and friends, cook, 
          do yoga and watch youtube videos on coding.
      </p>
